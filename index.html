        <p> Suggested approaches: </p>

        </BR> Have you ever acted on what the voices tell you? </BR> How do you cope with hearing these voices?

        <p> Suggested approaches: </BR> Active listening </BR> Ask directly about suicide.

        <p> Be direct: "Are you thinking of killing yourself?"  This will NOT cause a person to consider suicide as an option
