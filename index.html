        <summary>2.1.1 Hearing vs Listening</summary>
        <p>Hearing is a passive physiological process. </BR> Listening is an active process that involves understanding and comprehending what is heard, which requires attention and engagement.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>2.1.2 Active Listening</summary>
        <p>This is challenging when nonverbal things such as head nods are not an option, so we must do even more with our voice. </p>
        <p> Paraphrase and repeat back </BR> Ask clarifying questions </BR> "okay, uh-huh, etc.." is better than nothing </p>

      <details> 
        <summary> 3.1.1 Why do people make unethical choices? </summary>
        <p>Not all unethical choices are intentional. They are often made from "close enough" pattern matching that results in drift from policy. 
        </BR> Dispatchers tend to get decertified with around 12-13 years of experience, seemingly due to bad habits compounding and "close enough" choices. </p>
      </details>
      <details> 
        <summary> 3.1.2 System 1 vs System 2 </summary>
        <p>System 1 is responsible for the automatic reaction to a que or stimulus. System 2 is used when there is an intentional effort made to analyse the situation before reacting.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary> 3.1.3 How to avoid making unethical choices </summary>
        <p> Make good habits so that System 1 responses will be ethical ones. This is extremely important as System 1 is responsible for 75-90% of behavior.  </p>

        <p> If you suspect voices are present, ask: </BR> Are you hearing voices? </BR> What are they saying? 
        </BR> Have you ever acted on what the voices tell you? </BR> How do you cope with hearing these voices? 
        </BR> What have you done in the past to resist them?

‚Äúnuggets‚Äù of information in their words that may be helpful to guide next steps. </p> 
        <p> <u>Clinical Depression</u> </p>
        <p> Suggested approaches: </BR> Active listening </BR> Ask directly about suicide.

      <details> 
        <summary> 4.1.3 Suicide</summary>
        <p> Be direct: "Are you thinking of killing yourself?"  This will NOT cause a person to consider suicide as an option

      </details>
      <details> 
        <summary>6.1.2 The importance of being able to recognize these effects </summary>
          <p> <u>Early intervention prevents long-term harm </u> </p>
            <p> Public safety professionals‚Äîsuch as police officers, firefighters, EMTs, and dispatchers‚Äîare regularly exposed 
            to high-stress, life-threatening, and emotionally disturbing situations. Over time, 
            this exposure can lead to cumulative trauma, which may develop into serious mental health issues. </p>
            <p> Recognizing early signs‚Äîsuch as sleep problems, irritability, emotional numbness, or changes in 
            behavior‚Äîcan lead to timely support, reducing the risk of long-term psychological damage. </p>        
          <p> <u> Protect job performance and public safety </u></p>
            <p> Unaddressed trauma can impair judgment, decision-making, communication, and emotional regulation.
            For professionals responsible for protecting others, this can endanger both the public, themselves, and 
            their colleagues. Being able to identify trauma-related effects ensures personnel stay mentally sharp,
            emotionally resilient, and operationally effective. </p>
          <p> <u> Promote a healthier work culture </u></p>
            <p> Recognizing and openly addressing the impact of trauma helps reduce stigma around mental 
            health in public safety fields, where toughness is often overemphasized. This encourages peer support,
              open communication, and seeking help without shame. A culture that normalizes mental health care is 
              more sustainable and supportive.</p>
          <p> <u> Improve retention and career longevity </u></p>
            <p> </p>
      </details>
      <details> 
        <summary>6.1.3 Coping with the potential impacts of these effects </summary>
        <p> External processes: movement and talking </p>
        <p> Self-care strategies:</p>
        <p> Sleep, gratitude, exercise, meditation/yoga, nutrition, professional help, 
        breathe, support system, grounding, family/friends</p>
